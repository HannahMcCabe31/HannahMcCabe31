👋 Hi there! I'm Hannah, a language enthusiast turned aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer. 🚀

📚 With a strong background in teaching French and German, I've always loved breaking down complex concepts. I'm now channeling that passion for communication and problem-solving into the world of coding.

👨‍💻 I'm currently immersing myself in the dynamic world of web development as a full-time student at the School of Code Bootcamp.  I have a particular interest in understanding the intricacies of how things work and love the process of finding creative and efficient solutions to challenges.

🌐 As I continue my web development journey, I'm keen to connect with fellow developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts! 🚀
